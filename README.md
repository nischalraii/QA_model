# DistilBERT Question Answering Model

This repository contains a Colab notebook that trains a DistilBERT model on the SQuAD dataset for question answering tasks. The project demonstrates how to preprocess data, train the model, and use it to answer questions based on provided contexts. The trained model and tokenizer are saved for future use.
